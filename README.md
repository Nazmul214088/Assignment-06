1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
   Ans. <b>var: </b>Old way, function-scoped, can be redeclared & updated.<br>
        <b>let: </b> Block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.
       <b>const: </b>Block-scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared (value is constant).<br>
       <b>Best practice:</b> Use let when the value will change, and const when it wonâ€™t. Avoid var.
